## ðŸ”Ž What We Track

| Signal                  | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Prompt lineage          | Track which memory chunks were cited     |
| Slack feedback          | Feed into reranking and RAR triggers     |
| Vector hit/miss rates   | Gauge embedding effectiveness            |
| Latency + cost metrics  | Monitor response time + token cost       |
| RAR precision           | Score entailment / hallucination risk    |

## ðŸ”„ From RAG â†’ RAR

| Capability        | RAG             | RAR                                 |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Strategy          | Top-1 recall     | Compare top-N chunks for conflicts   |
| UX                | Plain answer     | Explanation + supporting evidence    |
| Slack usage       | Passive logs     | Feedback loop powers reranking       |

## ðŸ§ª Observability

We use:
- Prometheus metrics
- JSON logs with correlation IDs
- Grafana (planned)
- Notion/Slack feedback hooks
